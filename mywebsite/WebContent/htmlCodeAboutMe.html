<h1> Assad Hussain - Profile </h1>
<p>My name is Assad Hussain and I am a computer science graduate and hobbyist video game developer</p>
<p>I developed an interest in programming as an A-level student when I learned about how video games were made. This led to me to studying Computer Science at university full time and also taking up video game development as a hobby.
I studied for a degree in Bsc (Hons) Computer Science and achieved a 1st.
</p>
<p>In my spare time I train in Muay Thai at Calder Thai. I started this for reasons of self defence and because pretty much everyone 
around me was interested in Boxing, so I felt it necessary to diversify. </p>
